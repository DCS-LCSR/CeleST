        CeleST?</h2>

        <h2><a class="anchor" href="#about" id="about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

        <p>After initial video capture, you can take the frames and run them through CeleST.</p>

        <h4><u>Video Tracking/Processing</u></h4>

        <p>After the video is added to the software, CeleST can process it. This allows our software to "segment" the image in such a way that the individual worms are identified and outlined. This is all saved in a segmentation file that CeleST can then use to calculate measures.</p>

        <h4><u>Measures Computation</u></h4>

        <p>Using the segmentation data created by the video processing, CeleST will now calculate and compute each individual worms measures. It will then check with the user to determine validity and correctness of the results.</p>

        <h4><u>Measures values and Statistics</u></h4>

        <p>Once the measures have been calculated, they can be analyzed statistically. The statistical tests for the data can also be displayed and exported.</p>
        <p>The resulting measures and their descriptions are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
		  <li><strong>Wave initiation rate:</strong> is the number of body waves initiated from either the head or tail per minute. </li>
		  <li><strong>Body wave number:</strong> measures the number of waves in transit through the body at a point in time, and hence provides a snapshot of the “waviness” of the body posture. </li>
		  <li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> evaluates how balanced the swim posture is per stroke, as measured in the focal plane perpendicular to the camera.</li>
		  <li><strong>Stretch:</strong> measures the maximum differences in curvature that occur between the two most extreme curvature scores at any part of an animal during a given stroke, providing a sense of whether body bends are deep or flat and how much “stretching” effort occurs in a stroke.</li>
		  <li><strong>Attenuation:</strong> measures how well the depth of a wave is maintained as it propagates down the body.</li>
		  <li><strong>Reverse swimming:</strong> measures the percentage of time that an animal swims in reverse, initiating a body wave from the tail that propagates toward the head. </li>
		  <li><strong>Curling:</strong> measures the relative percentage of time that an animal spends bent around so far that it overlaps with itself.</li>
		  <li><strong>Travel speed:</strong> reflects the distance that an animal travels during a defined time.</li>
		  <li><strong>Brush stroke:</strong> reports on the area that the body of the animal would “paint” (the number of pixels covered) in a single complete stroke, giving an indication of the depth of the movement and the extent to which the animal has flexed in a given stroke.</li>
		  <li><strong>Activity index:</strong> sums up the number of pixels that are painted by the body during the time that it takes an animal to do two strokes to provide a sense of how vigorously the animal bends while swimming over time.</li>
		</ul>

        <h2><a class="anchor" href="#tutorials" id="tutorials"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a> Tutorials and Getting
        Started</h2>

        <p>To get started you must first download the CeleST package at the top of this page, and then decompress the file. This will leave you with a folder that you can rename to whatever you prefer. To start the program, open
        CeleST.m in Matlab, and click the play button. At the startup of CeleST, you will be greeted by a prompt that allows you to choose your save location. Clicking "Quit" will exit CeleST for you. Clicking "Use default" will 
        use the default save behavior of storing your data folder one directory up from source. Clicking on "Choose save location" will bring you to another prompt. Here you can click "Choose where to put new folder" to specify 
        which directory to put your data folder in, or, you can click "Choose existing data folder" to choose a specific data folder that you have from a previous session. From here you can follow the instructions included in the 
        pdf on how to use the software.</p>

        <h4>System Requirements:</h4>
        <ul>
			<li>Matlab 2014a, 2014b, or 2015a</li>
			<li>Mac OSX 10.8 Mountain Lion and later</li>
			<li>Suggested minimum screen resolution of 1440 x 960. Other sizes may work but clipping of certain graphics is likely to occur.</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2><a class="anchor" href="#common-issues" id="common-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Common Issues/Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
		  <li>When using the "Add multiple videos" button, you can select multiple folders to add. However, to add details, you must click the "Table editable" toggle and edit the table manually.</li>
		  <li>If part of a window seems to be cut off when it is first opened, try scrolling up or to the side.</li>
		  <li>If the image in the "Process Videos" section is cut off, make sure that you are using the correct version of CeleST and have the correct system requirements.</li>
		  <li>The export function will automatically place your exported CSV files into the program's database directory. If you don't know where that is located, be sure to change the save location when you export.</li>
		  <li>In the "Display Results" page when showing graphs, clicking the "Tests..." button will display an error if there are fewer than two samples. This is changed by closing the "Show Graphs" page and adding more samples.</li>
		</ul>

        to Report Problems</h2>

        <p>Problems during use of the program can be reported through our error reporting system. When one of the error report boxes appears, please type up the circumstances leading to the error and click send. This will send your statement along with automatic error data to the developers of the project.</p>
