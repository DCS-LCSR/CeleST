        CeleST?</h2>

        <h2><a class="anchor" href="#about" id="about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

        <p>After initial video capture, you can take the frames and run them through CeleST.</p>

        <h4>Video Tracking/Processing</h4>

        <p>After the video is added to the software, CeleST can process it. This allows our software to "segment" the image in such a way that the individual worms are identified and outlined. This is all saved in a segmentation file that CeleST can then use to calculate measures.</p>

        <h4>Measures Computation</h4>

        <p>Using the segmentation data created by the video processing, CeleST will now calculate and compute each individul worms measures. It will then check with the user to determine validity and correctness of the results.</p>

        <h4>Measures values and Statistics</h4>

        <p>Once the measures have been calculated, they can be analyzed statiscially. The statistical tests for the data can also be displayed and exported.</p>
        <p>The resulting measures and their descriptions are as follows:</p>
